<h3>Help: Data</h3>

<p>The <b>Data</b> section of the CMS is where you can edit the repetitive content on your site. This includes lists of information such as products, product categories, news or galleries. For non-repetitive content such as page headings or body text please see the help on <b>Pages</b>.</p>

<p>To edit this information please go to the <b>Data</b> section of the CMS. Down the left of the page is a list of <b>Datasets</b>. These are the lists of information you get to edit, add to and remove from. Clicking one of these will take you to a page listing all the data in that <b>Dataset</b>. Here you can add new data and edit or remove existing data. You can <b>filter</b> and <b>order</b> the list of data to help you find the information you want to edit faster.</p>
<p>An example of filtering/ordering would be for products where you want to view all products in a specific category, ordered by the date they were released. You would select an option such as <i>Category</i> in the <i>Filter By</i> box, then choose which category you want to filter by. The items you can select from in this list would be from your <b>Categories</b> dataset. You would then choose to order by <i>Release Date</i> and then click the <b>Filter/Order</b> button. To clear any filtering and ordering just click the <b>Reset</b> button.</p>
<p>Click the <b>edit</b> link at the end of any row to edit that items information. This works exactly like one of your <b>Pages</b>.</p>
