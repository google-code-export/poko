	<p>
		Datasets are created by assigning a Definition to a table in your database. When elements in the definition match database table (via their names) the data is made editable in the dataset and formatted according to the definition. 
		eg. 'Image' definitions produce a preview of the image and a file upload box. 
	</p>	
	
	<p>
		A definition can be assigned to many database tables.
