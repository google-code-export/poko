<h3>Help: Introduction</h3>

<p>You can use this CMS (Content Management System) to edit the content of your web site, as well as do things such as manage products and galleries. What you can do depends on what your CMS was set-up to do.</p>

<p>The best place to start is to read through the help sections on <b>Pages</b> and <b>Data</b> and then go to the respective sections at the top and have a try at editing your site's content. If you do not click the <b>Update</b> button at the bottom of the pages then you won't be updating your site, so have a play.</p>

<p>Make sure you use the <b>logout</b> link at the right of the menu after making changes to keep your site secure.</p>
